## 🎨 Design-to-Code Notes

During development, these steps were followed to transform the Figma design into functional UI:

1. Carefully analyzed Figma to identify missing or unclear components.
2. Conceptualized the missing elements using logical UX patterns.
3. Researched UI best practices to refine component structure and aesthetics.
4. Drafted rough sketches/wireframes to visualize the missing sections.
5. Implemented components in React using reusable, modular architecture with Tailwind CSS.

## 🧩 Missing Design Decisions (Components I Added & Why)
✔ 1. Footer

The Figma did not include a footer, so I added one to improve navigation, credibility, and website completeness.

✔ 2. CTA Banner

To improve conversions and user engagement, a call-to-action banner was added.

✔ 3. Invested Companies Section

Because the website is about investing, the Figma lacked a crucial section showcasing previously funded startups.
I added this with a marquee effect to highlight partner companies dynamically.

✔ 4. Form Pages

Important but missing in the design:

Contact Form

Career / Job Application Form

Join Us / Investment Request Form

These pages are necessary for user interaction and business functionality.

✔ 5. FAQs Section

Many users often have the same questions, so this was added to reduce friction and improve clarity.
